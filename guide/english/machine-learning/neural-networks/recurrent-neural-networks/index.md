## Recurrent Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs are a special type of neural network designed for sequence problems. It process sequences by iterating through the sequence elements and maintaining a state containing information relative to what it has seen so far. It is a type of neural network that has an internal loop.The recurrent connections add state or memory to the network and allow it to learn broader abstractions from the input sequences.
